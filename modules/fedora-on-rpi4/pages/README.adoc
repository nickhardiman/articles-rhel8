I'd like to write more Fedora step-by-step articles like 
https://fedoramagazine.org/create-a-wifi-hotspot-with-raspberry-pi-3-and-fedora/[this one I wrote for Fedora Magazine].
Only this time I'd like to use my new toy, an RPi4.

File content is https://asciidoctor.org/[ASCIIDoctor] markdown.
Some diagrams created with http://asciiflow.com/[asciiflow] and converted to SVG files by https://github.com/asciitosvg/asciitosvg[asciitosvg].
