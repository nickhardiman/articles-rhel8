= use the Bash shell

When you use the CLI of a Linux machine, the system gives you a shell. 
It's one of the three big pieces of an OS - the kernel, the shell and all the utility programs.
The _shell_ name comes from a nut or seed analogy - shell on the outside, kernel on the inside. 

The shell is a pillar of developer and sysadmin worlds, up there with the toolchain, the source code repository and the IDE.  A shell is a command interpreter that waits for your commands, ready to run its https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop[REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)] until you stop the program. 



== GNU Bash 

After logging in, you find yourself using GNU Bash, version 5. 

[source,shell]
----
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
   2708 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
   2940 pts/1    00:00:00 ps
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ bash --version

Ths interactive command line shell is nowhere near as friendly as a GUI. 
No-one is born knowing what '. ./.bashrc' means. 
But there's no avoiding it - the shell has been around forever (in IT terms) and is everywhere. For instance, if the Linux startup process goes wrong, you may find yourself in the https://fedoramagazine.org/initramfs-dracut-and-the-dracut-emergency-shell/[dracut emergency shell].
When you log into the system console, or SSH to a machine, or run tmux, you get your own copy of the _bash_ shell. 

Plenty of Bash configuration has been done for you by resource files. 
You've got plenty of environment variables (run _env_), shell options (run _shopt_), aliases (_alias_), a umask (_umask_) and a fancy prompt.



== the Bash back story 

In the 1980s, Unix systems included a shell written by Dr. Stephen Bourne, called the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell[Bourne shell]. 
When the GNU project created their shell, they based much of it on this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell[Bourne shell] and called it the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)[Bourne again shell] (see what they did there?). The old Bourne shell executable was named _sh_. You can't get your hands on this old program - the Bourne shell isn't available for Fedora. 
There is a file _/bin/sh_, but it's a symlink to _bash_. 

The new _bash_ does most things that _sh_ did. 
Dr. Bourne wrote an article for Byte magazine way back in 1983, called https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-10/1983_10_BYTE_08-10_UNIX#page/n187/mode/2up[The Unix Shell], to explain how to use his shell. 
The article contains many instantly recognizable commands. And - bonus - this article is sandwiched between stunning retro-ads for long-dead hardware and software - 64K RAM upgrade kit, anyone?  

OS distributions that include GNU software often use bash as the default shell. That's true for Fedora, other Linux distributions, and even Apple OS X. Bash isn't the default everywhere - it's available for FreeBSD, but the default is _sh_. 

Bash, like sh, is written in C. You can get the https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git[source code] from https://savannah.gnu.org/[Savannah], Gnu's software site.



== resource files 

The home directory contains many configuration files. 
They are known as dotfiles, or hidden files - they start with "." and Bash doesn't display them.

[source,shell]
---- 
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ ls -d .*
.   .bash_history  .bash_profile  .cache   .local    .ssh
..  .bash_logout   .bashrc        .config  .mozilla
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
----

* .bash_history  - a list of all the commands you have run so far. To see the maximum number of commands this stores, run _echo $HISTSIZE_.
* .bash_logout  - When Bash exits, any commands in here are run. Usually, no-one bothers adding any. 
* .bash_profile  - This is the traditional place for a user to add their own customized settings. There's a similar file (/etc/profile) that defines settings everyone gets. 
* .bashrc  - functions and aliases. You also get everything in /etc/bashrc.
* .ssh - This one's actually a directory used by SSH, not Bash.

If you want to know more about dotfiles, read this great https://fedoramagazine.org/customizing-bash/[Customizing Bash] article.



== interactive shell vs. non-interactive shell 

An https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Interactive-Shells[interactive shell] is connected to a user terminal - it reads from the keyboard and writes to the screen. 

The shell knows whether it is interactive.
It behaves differently frorm a non-interactive shell. 
To see the interactiive option, use the variable *$-* to display a list of shell options.
The option _i_ means interactive.
If you want to know what the other letters mean, run _man bash_ and look for _set_ in the _BASH BUILTIN COMMANDS_ section.

[source,shell]
---- 
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ echo $-
himBHs
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
----

Also, if it's got a prompt, it's an interactive shell.



== login shell vs. non-login shell

A Bash login shell is for use by a person. 
A non-login shell is for use by a program. 

When you login, you get a login shell.
The /etc/profile script runs and sets up all kinds of variables, defines shortcuts, runs programs and anything else that makes life easier for the command line user.

When a script runs, it doesn't need all this extra help.
If a bash shell runs a command and exits, it doesn't need to be a login shell.
The non-login shell provides the essentials. 
Bash non-login shells run only /etc/bashrc, not /etc/profile.

One of the shell options describes whether the bash shell is a login shell. 

Check you are using a login shell. 

[source,shell]
---- 
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ shopt login_shell
login_shell    	on
[nick@rpi4 ~]$
----

Fire up a bash shell that only runs one command then exits. 
The -c option tells bash to start a non-login shell.

[source,shell]
---- 
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ bash -c 'shopt login_shell'
login_shell    	off
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
----

Another sign of a login shell - a peculiar one - is a hyphen added to the name.
Check your login shell. 

[source,shell]
---- 
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ echo $0
-bash
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
----

Repeat the non-login shell trick. 

[source,shell]
----  
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ bash -c 'echo $0'
bash
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
----


== getting to grips with Bash 

Bash knowledge is not shared out equally. 
Some knowledge is universal - you can't use Bash for five minutes without running _ls_. 
And some knowledge is arcane, like job control.
If you really want to find out what Bash is capable of, read the https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html[manual]. 


If you just want some simple gratification, play around with these. 


=== examine the prompt 

[source,shell]
---- 
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
----

A special set of symbols define how the prompt looks. 

[source,shell]
---- 
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ echo $PS1
[\u@\h \W]\$
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
----

To play around with the prompt layout, look at the man page (_man bash_) and search for _PROMPTING_. 
It has a big list of these backslash-escaped special characters.


=== try completion 

Typing long commands is annoying. 
That's why the GNU project added  https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion.html[programmable completion].
The easiest completion is typing the first few characters of a command (three usually does it) and hitting the tab key (⇥). 

[source,shell]
---- 
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ host⇥
host         hostid       hostname     hostnamectl  
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ host
----

Try the same thing with less letters and more tabbing. 
Entering _hos_ and hitting tab only matches _host_, so that appears on the same line.  
Hitting tab twice more displays the list of commands that start with _host_.
