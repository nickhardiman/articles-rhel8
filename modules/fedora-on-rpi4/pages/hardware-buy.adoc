A computer system is built up of layers. There's the hardware layer at the bottom, then a layer of software that makes this hardware work, then another layer of software that makes a computer useful. The software in the middle, being halfway between hardware and software, is called firmware.

Buying computer hardware is expensive, even at this home-hobbyist level. In fact, the first barrier to getting started with a Raspberry Pi 4 is the cash barrier. Working with the US dollar, de-facto currency of the world, expect to lay out a few hundred bucks. 

You need an RPi4 - yep, so far so obvious - and you also need a fair amount of other hardware. 

* *current network*. Perhaps this is your home lab.
* *ethernet cable*. This connects the current network to the Raspberry Pi
* *Raspberry Pi 4 model B 8GB*. Don't get the 1, 2 or 4GB versions, nor the Compute Module 4.
* *power supply*
* *64GB micro-SD card*. We'll be packing a lot of content on here. USB storage is _way_ faster, but ???
* *keyboard*, *video monitor* and *mouse*. This hardware combination is so common it used to be abbreviated to KVM, until Kernel-based Virtual Machines came along and stole the acronym. 
* *HDMI cable*. This cable needs a micro-HDMI plug on the Pi end, and probably a full size HDMI plug on the other. 

No fan, no heatsink, no USB storage, no HAT.

Much of this hardware is only required to get started. 
When everything is set up, you can connect from another computer over the network to the Raspberry Pi and do everything you need on the CLI (Command Line Interface).
