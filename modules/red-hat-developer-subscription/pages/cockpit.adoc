https://cockpit-project.org/[Cockpit] is a server management system with a web-based control panel.

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_systems_using_the_rhel_8_web_console/index[cockpit] 
is installed on RHEL 8 hosts, but not enabled. 

Connecting to a RHEL 8 host displays an MOTD (Message of the Day) that lets the user know cockpit is waiting to be enabled.

== enable cockpit 

Enable and start the systemd unit cockpit.socket. 
Connecting to the socket starts cockpit.service.

[source,console]
....
[nick@host ~]$ systemctl status cockpit.socket
● cockpit.socket - Cockpit Web Service Socket

After it's enabled, the MOTD message changes.

The service is available on port 9090, with an URL along the lines of https://10.0.1.45:9090/.

The default server config uses a self-signed certificate.

[source,console]
----
[nick@guest1 ~]$ sudo remotectl certificate
[sudo] password for nick: 
certificate: /etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d/0-self-signed.cert
[nick@guest1 ~]$ 
----

 Web browsers don't like self-signed certificates. 
 Chrome displays this warning.

[source,console]
----

Luckily it still offers the option to `Proceed to 10.0.1.45 (unsafe)`.

Chrome continues to cause problems behind the scenes. 
The journal may contain many _gnutls_handshake_ errors. 

[source,console]

== satellite integration 

https://100things.wzzrd.com/2018/06/27/Running-cockpit-on-a-Satellite-Capsule-Foreman-Proxy.html[Running cockpit on a Satellite Capsule / Foreman Proxy]

https://theforeman.org/plugins/foreman_remote_execution/1.7/index.html

3.6 Cockpit integration

To automatically sign to managed host’s Cockpit web interface, click on “Web Console” button on the host detail page. The button only appears when plugin was installed with --enable-foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-cockpit option. The managed host must also have the cockpit-system package installed.

Chris Proctor's mail 

On the satellite server you need to do:

[source,console]
----
foreman-installer --scenario satellite --enable-foreman-plugin-remote-execution-cockpit
----

which adds the "web console" button to the satellite gui. Thats the bit I'd missed 🙄


Then on the client you need to install the packages with `yum install cockpit`.

You don't need to enable the socket or anything like that, just install the packages.

You also need to allow the foreman-proxy to login to the server via ssh without a password.

[source,console]
----
ssh-copy-id ~foreman-proxy/.ssh/id_rsa_foreman_proxy.pub root@client
----

If you want to use a different user then you can change the user the remote execution uses to log in. In satellite go to Administer-> Settings and on the Remote Execution tab change the  "SSH User" setting to a valid user on the client, then use ssh-copy-id to copy the foreman-proxy user's ssh key to the appropriate home directory on the client, e.g.:

[source,console]
----
ssh-copy-id ~foreman-proxy/.ssh/id_rsa_foreman_proxy.pub user@client
----

and at that point the "web console" button will take you into cockpit running as the non-privileged user, so you will be able to view settings, but to change them you will need the appropriate sudo settings.

Cockpit itself works by having a web interface (running on the satellite in our case) that talks to the client using ssh as a transport mechanism, but instead of running a bash shell on the client it runs cockpit-bridge which uses the cockpit pam stack to authenticate and can run commands, talk to dbus etc and sends the results back in a way the gui can understand. So we need ssh ports open between the satellite and the client but shouldn't need anything else.
