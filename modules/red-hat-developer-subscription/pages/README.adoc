= articles about the Red Hat Developer Subscription

Not finished, let alone published.
Please feel free to use, and all feedback is welcome. 

The files here are my attempt to document what is bundled with the free developer subscription, 
and how to use it.
The docs cover activities like these. 

File content is https://asciidoctor.org/[ASCIIDoctor] markdown.
Some diagrams created with http://asciiflow.com/[asciiflow] and converted to SVG files by https://github.com/asciitosvg/asciitosvg[asciitosvg]. 
The slightly odd site layout is required by the https://antora.org/[Antora static site generator].   

The site nav is here. 
https://github.com/nickhardiman/articles/blob/main/modules/red-hat-developer-subscription/nav.adoc
Unfortunately the links in this _nav.adoc_ source file don't work (_file.adoc_ would have to be changed to _pages/file.adoc_).
This list is a github-friendly copy.
It may get out of date if I can't be bothered to keep _README.adoc_ and _nav.adoc_ in sync.
