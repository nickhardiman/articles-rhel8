Tell ansible to set up an account for SSH

Create a remote account called ansible_user that ansible can use for SSH connections. 
This account will be authenticated using a key pair, and will have passwordless sudo access.
This account is for the managed nodes only. 
Don't set it up on the control node.

We even set this account up on the host itself, so the _guest1_ control node can treat _host_ like a managed node. 
The concept of a guest virtual machine making changes on the host physical machine seems a little weird. 
But that's the way many provisioning systems work.

Ansible playbooks will provision other guest VMs. 
Ansible is running in a guest VM, to keep messy development work off the host machine. 
Giving ansible power over the hypervisor means allowing a VM to make changes to its host. 

Sound like a security flaw? 
Sure does! This procedure adds a new user _ansible_user_ to the host and gives it full passwordless sudoers rights. 
In a shared environment, this DIY setup would be a headache. 
In production, it would be a disaster.
But it's fine for this self-contained development environment. 

== SSH from guest to host 

Check access. 
Use the address of the Internet gateway. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@guest1 ~]$ ip route list
default via 192.168.122.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100 
192.168.122.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.122.100 metric 100 
[nick@guest1 ~]$ 
[nick@guest1 ~]$ ssh 192.168.122.1
nick@192.168.122.1's password: 
Web console: https://host.lab.example.com:9090/ or https://10.0.1.40:9090/

Last login: Mon Jun  1 17:37:25 2020 from 192.168.122.100
[nick@host ~]$ 
[nick@host ~]$ exit
logout
Connection to 192.168.122.1 closed.
[nick@guest1 ~]$

== automate 

Create an ansible role using ``ansible-galaxy``.



Add content to half a dozen files. 
The ``ansible-galaxy`` command adds many more that we either don't need yet or we will never need. 
For instance, README.md is essential for sharing, but we are not sharing yet.
