Install the HAProxy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server[proxy server] on _guest1_. 
HAProxy is an intermediary between a web client and the web servers on _guest2_ and _guest3_.  
HAProxy is also a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)[load balancer], distributing requests evenly between _guest2_ and _guest3_.

HAProxy is a reverse proxy - it sends requests from many clients to a few servers.
The forward and reverse names come from an old networking idea that a device has a front and a back. 
Network kit, like an office, has a front end used by customers and a back end used by administrators. 
If the customers are in the office, the network kit is oriented so the front end faces them.
If customers are in the Internet, the network kit is reversed so the front faces them.
It's a https://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Faulty-Analogy.html[faulty analogy] that has confused many people over many years. 

A proxy may talk a special proxy protocol, which requires clients are able to talk the same language. 
Or it may be transparent, where no client change is required. 
HAProxy is configured here to be transparent - it appears to be a regular web site.



== a load balancer 

The web servers on _guest2_ and _guest3_ are identical. 
It doesn't matter which one answers an HTTP request. 

HAProxy has a list of web servers and sends each new request to the next server on the list. 
This is a simple load-balancing algorithm called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)#Round-Robin[round-robin].

Other load balancing algorithms are _leastconn_, _source_ and _hdr_.
These are described in the file _/usr/share/doc/haproxy/intro.txt_.

In this example, curl is the web client and makes four requests. 
HAProxy even distributes these requests between the two nginx web servers.

== install 

[source,shell]
....
yum install -y haproxy
....


== configure 

The config file /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg is about 90 lines and load balances a cluster of applications running on the local machine _guest1_. 
There are no matching applications on the local machine, so haproxy isn't really doing anything useful.

[source,shell]
....
[root@guest1 ~]# cat  /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg 
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example configuration for a possible web application.  See the
# full configuration options online.

=== add a stats page 

Add a stats page. 


[source,shell]
....
listen stats
    bind :9000
    mode http
    stats enable
    stats uri /
    monitor-uri /healthz
....



=== open the firewall

[source,shell]
....
[root@guest1 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-port 9000/tcp
success
[root@guest1 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-port 9000/tcp --permanent
success
[root@guest1 ~]# 
....

Find the home network address of _guest1_.
In this example it's _192.168.1.217_. 

[source,shell]
....
ip addr show dev enp1s0
....


=== view the stats page  

Open a web browser on the workstation.

Enter a URL in the form of http://192.168.1.217:9000/.

View the dashboard. 
The default app does not exist, so checks are failing.
Many lines are colored red.
