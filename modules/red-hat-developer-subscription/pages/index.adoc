Not finished, let alone published.
Please feel free to use, and all feedback is welcome. 

The files here are my attempt to document what is bundled with the free developer subscription,

The docs cover activities like these. 

File content is https://asciidoctor.org/[ASCIIDoctor] markdown.
Some diagrams created with http://asciiflow.com/[asciiflow] and converted to SVG files by https://github.com/asciitosvg/asciitosvg[asciitosvg].
