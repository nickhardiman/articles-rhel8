Set up a name and address for the new VM _guest2_. Use dnsmasq to fix the IP address _192.168.122.100_ and the 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name[FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)] _guest2.private.example.com_.

RHEL 8 includes a complete system for managing VMs (virtual machines) - the KVM hypervisor, QEMU machine emulator and libvirt tools. 
The libvirt daemon uses http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html[dnsmasq] to provide 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol[DHCP] 
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System[DNS] services. 
This article configures dnsmasq to set a fixed IPv4 address and domain name for our new guest VM. 

The default DHCP setup isn't great if you want to SSH to your new VM, because it takes some work to figure out what IPv4 address to use.  
When the guest VM boots up, it is given the address 192.168.122...er...something. 
The dnsmasq DHCP service assigns addresses from an IP pool, so the VM gets a random address from the range 192.168.122.0/24. 
Instead of searching for the address after every boot, it's easier to assign a fixed IP address. 
All we need to get started is the MAC address, and that was fixed by ``virt-install`` when the VM was created (``52:54:00:00:00:01``). 

People remember names better than numbers. A fixed IP address is easier to use than a random IP address, and a DNS name is easier still.  
Out of the box, dnsmasq reads names and addresses from the /etc/hosts file. 
If _guest2.private.example.com_ is in the hosts file, that would assign the name to the address.
But this setup is more complicated - we want the name associated with the IP address, and the IP address associated with the MAC address. That requires adding details to two places, not one. 

* the host's /etc/hosts file, so the host can look up the guest's name
* the host's dnsmasq configuration, so guests can look up the name


== dnsmasq services 

libvirtd controls dnsmasq services, not systemd. 
One pair of processes - a parent and child - are started for each libvirt network that needs DHCP.
The _pubbr0_ network doesn't use dnsmasq.
The _default_ and _privbr0_ networks do.

Running the command ``systemctl status dnsmasq`` says dnsmasq isn't running. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@host1 libvirt]# ps -fwwC dnsmasq
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD

   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/dnsmasq.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)
[root@host1 ~]# 
....



== check the IP pool 

The dnsmasq server uses the config file at /var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.conf. This ``dhcp-range`` line tells dnsmasq what IP pool to manage. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo grep dhcp-range /var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.conf
dhcp-range=192.168.122.2,192.168.122.254
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
....

libvirt writes that dnsmasq configuration after reading its own network configuration.
You can see libvirt's configuration  using the ``virsh net-dumpxml`` command.
There are about 20 lines of XML that define the network.
These are all listed further down. 

Here's the IP pool config.  

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-dumpxml default
...
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.122.2' end='192.168.122.254'/>
    </dhcp>
...
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
....


== assign a name and address

Add an XML tag to the network's configuration.

This dnsmasq config file can't be edited directly because it's created by libvirt - any changes would be overwritten. 
Instead, use ``virsh`` commands to add config. 


=== add the private.example.com domain 

Add the domain _private.example.com_ before adding the name _guest2.private.example.com_.

dnsmasq has a security feature that ignores DNS domains it doesn't recognize. 
The default configuration has no domain, so adding a full FQDN for the VM (_guest2.private.example.com_) won't work. Journalctl would show an error like this. 

[source,shell]
....
May 29 18:17:15 host.private.example.com dnsmasq-dhcp[2380]: Ignoring domain private.example.com for DHCP host name guest2
....

Add a domain by editing the XML configuration and adding the line ``<domain name='private.example.com' localOnly='yes'/>``.

Adding a domain is a little painful, both because editing XML is never fun, and because the network must be stopped and started after this edit to pick up the configuration change. 


[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-edit default
....

virsh fires up the vi editor. 
Add the _domain_ line. 

[source,xml]
....
<network>
  <name>default</name>
  <uuid>df3899c4-85ed-4742-a2b6-3ef57346f165</uuid>
  <forward mode='nat'>
    <nat>
      <port start='1024' end='65535'/>
    </nat>
  </forward>
  <bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/>
  <mac address='52:54:00:74:ca:3c'/>
  <domain name='private.example.com' localOnly='yes'/>
  <ip address='192.168.122.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.122.2' end='192.168.122.254'/>
      <host mac='52:54:00:00:00:01' name='guest2.private.example.com' ip='192.168.122.100'/>
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>
....

Save and exit. 

Restart the network. Check its state before and after - it changes from _inactive_ to _active_. 

[source,shell]
....
Network default XML configuration edited.

[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-destroy default
Network default destroyed

[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-list --all
 Name                 State      Autostart     Persistent
----------------------------------------------------------
 default              inactive   yes           yes

[nick@host1 ~]$ 
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-start default
Network default started

[nick@host1 ~]$ 
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-list --all
 Name                 State      Autostart     Persistent
----------------------------------------------------------
 default              active     yes           yes

[nick@host1 ~]$ 
....

Virsh updates the dnsmasq config.

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo grep private.example.com /var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/default.conf
local=/private.example.com/
domain=private.example.com
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
....



=== add the FQDN and IPv4 address to libvirt's config

Use virsh net-update, which doesn't require a network restart. 
The command contains the line of XML to be added. 
The name in the _name_ attribute matches the hostname set by the ``virt-customize`` command.
The ``--live`` and ``--config`` options make sure both the current configuration and the stored config are updated.

[source,shell]
....
sudo virsh net-update default add ip-dhcp-host \
    "<host  mac='52:54:00:00:00:01' name='guest2.private.example.com' ip='192.168.122.100' />" \
    --live \
    --config
....

Add the host line. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo virsh net-update default add ip-dhcp-host "<host mac='52:54:00:00:00:01' name='guest2.private.example.com' ip='192.168.122.100' />" --live --config
Updated network default persistent config and live state
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
....

You can remove this line by replacing ``add`` with ``delete``. 


=== add the FQDN and IPv4 address to the host 

Libvirt knows about your new machine, but your host machine has no idea.

Add a line to /etc/hosts. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ sudo bash -c 'echo "192.168.122.100 guest2 guest2.private.example.com" >> /etc/hosts'
[nick@host1 ~]$ 
....


== check your work 

=== watch the activity log

When the _guest2_ VM starts, it uses DHCP to obtain an IP address.
The guest VM starts by broadcasting a 'looking for DHCP server' message and gets an answer from dnsmasq on the host machine. 
You can see the conversation taking place using ``journalctl``.

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ journalctl -f
...

....


=== start the VM 

Check whether guest2 is running with ``virsh dominfo guest2``.
Stop the guest VM with ``virsh shutdown guest2``. 
Start with ``virsh shutdown guest2``.



=== resolve the name 

dnsmasq only listens to the libvirt network interface. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ host guest2 192.168.122.1
Using domain server:
Name: 192.168.122.1

[nick@host1 ~]$ 
....

Can the host find it?

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]$ ping -c1 guest2

== automate 

This is obviously a massive PITA.
Use ansible.
