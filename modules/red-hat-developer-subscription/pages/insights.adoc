Insights is distributed. There's the on-premise client, and the off-premise service that Red Hat runs in the cloud. 
The local client collects data and sends it to the remote Red Hat service, which analyzes it and delivers results. 

Red Hat provides a management web interface at https://cloud.redhat.com/insights/.

When you SSH to your fresh RHEL 8 install, you see this MOTD (Message Of The Day).
If you're on the Gnome desktop, you can only see these messages by looking at their files - ``cat /etc/motd.d/*``.

== components 

* engine: _/usr/bin/insights-client_

=== engine 

The easiest way to see what  _insights-client_ does is to run the application and watch the logs. 

[root@host1 ~]# /usr/bin/insights-client --retry 3

== cloud service 

https://cloud.redhat.com/insights/inventory/0123e32d-b1af-4261-8f4e-f38f9565532c


=== log 

After registering with the Insights service, a new log file appears: /var/log/insights-client/insights-client.log.


=== config 

The /etc/insights-client/ directory contains many files, including some hidden ones. 

The https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2462091[insights-client creates a UUID].

[source,console]
----
[nick@host1 ~]$ cat /etc/insights-client/machine-id

[nick@host1 ~]$ 
----

=== systemd 

The service runs once a day. 
This is managed by Systemd (the unit file is _/usr/lib/systemd/system/insights-client.timer_).

There's also a service that can be run (/usr/lib/systemd/system/insights-client.service).
It's disabled by default.
The unit's process type is _simple_ - it kicks off _/usr/bin/insights-client_ and exits.
