Devices get data into a computer, the CPU shifts the data around and changes it, and devices get the data back out of the computer. 
There's a world of complication behind that, which most people never see. 
The automation is so good there's no reason to tinker behind the scenes. 


It's hard to get to grips with what's going at the interface between hardware and software. 
Analogies are good for getting started, but don't really explain what's going on. 

The software kernel is like plumbing - without pipes, no water comes out of the taps. 
Except there is no tube, no water and no tap. 

The hardware is divided into CPU and memory. 
The CPU has registers. 

Learn what's going on by learning to program with assembly language. 

== hello world
