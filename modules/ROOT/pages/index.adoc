What fun can be had with a free developer subscription? I occasionally get the time to play around and update my technical documentation here. 

[NOTE]
====
These docs have nothing to do with the official https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8[Product Documentation for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8].

The _Here_ option above, up top in the navbar, can take you to my other documentation sections. There's a pop-up selector bottom left that does the same kind of thing.

== this section 

Articles cover sysadmin tasks like these.  

* Install RHEL 8 on a physical machine
* Create a network of virtual machines.
* Add containers to VMs. 
* Set up developer environments. 

All these articles have examples to run, so you can learn by doing. Hands on a keyboard. Break it and fix it. 


== my test machine

I did all the work in my home lab using this combination of hardware and software.  
I did have to buy the hardware. 
The software is all included with a free https://developers.redhat.com/[Developer Subscription].
