I'm Nick. I'm an infrastructure consultant at Red Hat.
"Infrastructure" means I do a lot of work on platforms, automation and containers in the IT world. 

If you want to hear my English accent, check out my Red Hat Summit On-Demand Session https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/sum22/SessionCatalog22/session/1639849813644001fptx[Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux on a remote bare-metal server, using Ansible, Kickstart, and Redfish]. 

If you are looking for technical help, stick a word in the search bar above. The site you are looking at here is my collection of hardware and software notes. 
If it's tech I've played with and had the time to write up, you'll find my docs here. 

If you want to get in touch, try https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickhardiman/[LinkedIn] or https://twitter.com/obi_larg_kenobi[Twitter].
I'm usually happy to talk.

The _Here_ option above, up top in the navbar, can take you to my other documentation sections. There's a pop-up selector bottom left that does the same kind of thing.

What fun can be had with a free developer subscription? I occasionally get the time to play around and update my technical documentation here. 

[NOTE]
====
These docs have nothing to do with the official https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8[Product Documentation for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8].
====

Articles cover sysadmin tasks like these.  

* Install RHEL 8 on a physical machine
* Create a network of virtual machines.
* Add containers to VMs. 
* Set up developer environments. 

All these articles have examples to run, so you can learn by doing. Hands on a keyboard. Break it and fix it.
