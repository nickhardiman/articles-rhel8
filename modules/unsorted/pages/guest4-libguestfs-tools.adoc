:revdate: 23-11-2020

Create a new storage volume, _guest4.qcow2_.
Base it on Red Hat's ready-made KVM image.
Make a copy of _rhel-8.3-x86_64-kvm.qcow2_ and customize it. 
A new virtual machine will built from this copy.

Before creating this VM, collect content and tools on _host1_.

* xref:virtual-network:libvirt-storage-volume-rhel8-kvm.adoc[]

This process uses the _virt-filesystems_, _virt-resize_ and _virt-customize_ utilities from the _libguestfs-tools_ package.

== a golden image 

Creating a VM using a golden image is quicker than a fresh install. 
Creating many VMs using a golden image does not mean they are all identical - Each new image is edited to make a few configuration changes. 
A new machine may need a unique MAC address, host name and private key. 
A golden image is often a base OS, rather than a complete installation. 
It contains a minimal set of packages, ready to extend for business applications. 

An alternative process is a _fresh install_, where all packages are  installed  from scratch onto an empty volume.
The _guest1_ VM is a fresh install, using a kickstart file to automate the process. 



== examine the golden image 


Install the _libguestfs-tools_ package. 

[source,shell]
----
sudo dnf install libguestfs-tools
----

View the partitions inside the _rhel-8.3-x86_64-kvm.qcow2_ file. 


== use virt-inspector

The _virt-inspector_ utility can display this information. 
The command `virt-inspector rhel-8.3-x86_64-kvm.qcow2` displays a lot of information about this file. 
In fact, it produces a vast amount of data  - far more than required here.
It's a long XML document, mostly describing installed packages. 

[source,shell]

Use XPATH to display the filesystem part of the XML document.

== use virt-filesystems

Use the _virt-filesystems_ command to display a list of partitions. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 ~]# cd /var/lib/libvirt/images/
[root@host1 images]# 
[root@host1 images]# virt-filesystems --parts --add rhel-8.3-x86_64-kvm.qcow2  
/dev/sda1
/dev/sda2
/dev/sda3
[root@host1 images]# 
----


Take a closer look at those partitions by listing file systems. 
The root file system is _/dev/sda3_, which is nearly 10GiB in size (10629414912 bytes). 

The file is about at tenth the size of this partition. 
A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qcow[QCOW] file can be compressed to save space. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 images]# virt-filesystems --filesystems --long --add rhel-8.3-x86_64-kvm.qcow2 
Name       Type        VFS   Label  Size         Parent
/dev/sda2  filesystem  vfat  -      104857600    -

== create an empty volume  

Copy the QCOW image file.  
Don't use this original file for creating a machine. 
It can remain as the backup file. 

First create an empty qcow2 image file. 
The command _virsh vol-create-as_ needs a pool name, the new file name and how big the volume should be. 
If you can't remember your pool name, run _virsh pool-list_ to check.

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 images]# MY_COPY=guest4.qcow2
[root@host1 images]# SIZE=300G
[root@host1 images]# virsh vol-create-as --format qcow2 images $MY_COPY $SIZE
Vol guest4 created

[root@host1 images]# 
----

This huge 300G volume is compressed down into a tiny file. 
This is called a sparse volume. 
The whole 300 GiB is not allocated now - space is added later, when it is required.

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 images]# ls -lh $MY_COPY
-rw-------. 1 root root 197K Feb 24 19:40 guest4.qcow2
[root@host1 images]# 
----

It doesn't take long for libvirt to notice the new file and add config to its volume inventory. 

List libvirt's config with this _virsh vol-info_ command. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 images]# virsh vol-info guest4.qcow2 images
Name:           guest4.qcow2
Type:           file
Capacity:       300.00 GiB
Allocation:     200.00 KiB

[root@host1 images]# 
----

List all the volumes with `virsh vol-list images`.
If the new file isn't there, try running `virsh pool-refresh images`.


=== delete 

If you want to remove this new file and start again, delete it with _virsh vol-delete_. 
Don't use the bash command _rm_ because it removes the file and leaves behind libvirt's configuration about this file. 
The _vol-delete_ command removes both the file and libvirt's config. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 images]# virsh vol-delete $MY_COPY --pool images
Vol guest4 deleted

[root@host1 images]# 
----



== fill the empty volume

Fill up the new volume using the _virt_resize_ command. 
This doesn't actually resize one file in-place - it reads one file and overwrites a second file. 
Virt_resize expands the volume in the second file while it's copying.

Libvirt does come with a volume copying command, _virsh vol-clone_. It can make a new copy, but it can't change its size. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@host1 images]# MY_COPY=guest4.qcow2
[root@host1 images]# GOLDEN_IMAGE=rhel-8.3-x86_64-kvm.qcow2

Summary of changes:

/dev/sda1: This partition will be left alone.

/dev/sda2: This partition will be left alone.

/dev/sda3: This partition will be resized from 9.9G to 299.9G.  The 
filesystem xfs on /dev/sda3 will be expanded using the ‘xfs_growfs’ 
method.

== customize the KVM image  

This image has no root password and no other accounts, so we can't log in.
Change this and a few other things with the ``virt-customize`` command.

Check out that insecure password. 


[source,shell]
----
virt-customize \
  --add            guest4.qcow2  \
  --root-password  password:'x%5ckA-1'  \
  --hostname       guest4.private.example.com  \
  --timezone       'Europe/London'  \
  --selinux-relabel
----

The _virt-customize_ command takes a few seconds. 
It prints an activity log, along with seconds elapsed.

[source,shell]
----
